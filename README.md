# C-ObjectAccessUsingV8
Wrapping an object which is created in C++ and making it available in JavaScript, using v8

I was trying to figure out how to wrap C++ objects in JavaScript. Most of the code I found online is old and is not working with current version of  v8. It's based on the HelloWorld exmple of V8 so that it is not overly complex and anyone who can get the HelloWorld exmple up can compile and run this also.
